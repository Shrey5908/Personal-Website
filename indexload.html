        <h2>I'm <span>Shrey Varshney</span>,</h2>
        <p>
          a passionate B.Tech student diving headfirst into the world of code.
          With Python, C++, and frontend skills in my toolbox, I'm on a mission
          to become a senior developer at a top-tier product company.
        </p>
        <p>But that's just the beginning.</p>
        <p>
          While textbooks fuel my intellect, freelancing as a part-time frontend
          developer fuels my creativity. I'm not just writing code, I'm painting
          digital experiences that captivate and innovate.
        </p>
        <p>
          This journey is more than a careerâ€”it's a chance to redefine
          possibilities, blend innovation with ambition, and code a future
          that's truly extraordinary.
        </p>
        <p>Here's to coding, creating, and an odyssey that's boundless. ðŸŒŸ</p>
